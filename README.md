# UTD-DSA-Resources
This repository is designed to serve as an archive and a arsenal for the UTD DSA club, or more broadly for any college leftist club. 

Contribution Guidelines:
1a. Specific resources should be directed to a folder for their project - powerpoints, leaflets, etc eg Chartwells -> Fliers -> Facts about Chartwells
1b. General resources should be put into a folder reflecting their form and function - eg Templates -> Fliers, Memes -> Economy
2. Contributions should reflect positively on the organization - this repository is mirrored in a public google drive. 
3. Contributions not made for general distribution should be marked <marking pattern here> so they are not reflected in the public google drive.
